    "# UDF to implement - SplitUDF\n",
    "The UDF funciton to be added in Excel is SplictUDF. It works exactly the same as c# String.Split() method which returns an array of strings generated by splitting of original string separated by the delimiters passed as a parameter in Split() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirement\n",
    "1. function signature SplitUDF(string, delimiter)\n",
    "2. SplitUDF is an ***array formular*** that can perform multiple calculations on one or more of the items in an array. In other words, it can return the splicted string with Ctrl+Shift+Enter in multipler cells. The output array is in horizontal direction (in the same row).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "In Excel: \n",
    "Input cell A1 = SplitUDF(\"A,B,C\", \",\")\n",
